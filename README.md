drinkBirdModel
==============

Drinking bird model using three.js

To run the html file you will also need : 
-OrbitAndPanControlsYann.js (using another student's fix)
-tubeTry.js (to create the neck clamp, else comment out code and use the cylinder)
-Coordinates.js  (file from Udacity cs291 course: https://github.com/udacity/cs291 --see the lib dir)
-three.js  (http://threejs.org/)
-browser that supports WebGL (http://get.webgl.org/)

In the html file be sure to change the javascript references to point to the right locations.
